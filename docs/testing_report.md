# Testing Report

## Environment
- Python version: 3.12.10
- Repo commit: 9dde952

## Automated Tests

All automated tests were executed with `pytest`:

```
.........................................................                [100%]

... (truncated warnings)
```

All tests passed successfully.

## OpenRouter Connection Test

The environment did not provide an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Running a minimal test script resulted in:

```
API key: None
No API key provided
```

A `curl` request to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` succeeded with HTTP 200, confirming network access to `openrouter.ai`.

## Required Changes and Allowed Domains

- The default OpenRouter model is now `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b` across configuration files and documentation.
- Provide `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the environment to fully exercise OpenRouter-related tests.
- Allow outbound traffic to `openrouter.ai` so the backend can communicate with the OpenRouter service.
