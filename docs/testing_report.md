*Updated: 2025-06-19 - MCP Integration Testing*

## Environment
- Python version: 3.10.17
- Repo commit: Latest with MCP integration

## Automated Tests

### Core Tests
All automated tests were executed with `pytest`:

```
tests/test_tui.py ...................                                    [100%]
19 passed in 0.25s
```

### MCP Integration Tests
New comprehensive MCP test suite:

```
tests/test_mcp_integration.py ...................                        [100%]
19 passed in 0.16s
```

**Total: 38 tests passed successfully**

### MCP Test Coverage
- **TestMCPModels**: Protocol models and data structures (4 tests)
- **TestMCPClient**: Client connection and communication (3 tests)  
- **TestMCPToolAdapter**: Tool adapter functionality (6 tests)
- **TestMCPIntegration**: Integration with Qwen-TUI (4 tests)
- **TestMCPDiscovery**: Server discovery and management (2 tests)

All MCP tests validate:
- Protocol model validation and schema conversion
- WebSocket client error handling
- Tool adapter execution and parameter validation
- Configuration integration
- Permission system compatibility
- Discovery service lifecycle

## OpenRouter Connection Test

The environment did not provide an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Running a minimal test script resulted in:

```
API key: None
No API key provided
```

A `curl` request to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` succeeded with HTTP 200, confirming network access to `openrouter.ai`.

## Required Changes and Allowed Domains

- The default OpenRouter model is now `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b` across configuration files and documentation.
- Provide `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the environment to fully exercise OpenRouter-related tests.
- Allow outbound traffic to `openrouter.ai` so the backend can communicate with the OpenRouter service.
